Welcome to the exciting world of Payroll Administration!  What you’ll
learn in this course is essential to your understanding of the
human-resources concept of payroll as it is interpreted from a business
perspective.  In applying the theoretical principles of the course in
real-world ways, you should gain a better understanding of yourself and
your work environment.  The goal of this course is to help you develop
the fundamental skills critical to payroll operations, and to help you
understand state and federal compliance.  This will provide you with a
foundation for becoming more versed on the depth of payroll as an
intricate component of human-resource management, and business overall.
Fundamentally, the concept of payroll is rooted in both human-resource
management and accounting principles.  From a human-resource management
perspective, the concept of payroll embodies compliance, which includes
the identification of the relationship between the employee and the
employer.  There are a number of legislative acts that must be adhered
to, as they assist in formulating how payroll is executed.  Payroll is
also an accounting concept, as all businesses are required to properly
track and record their financial transactions.  In most businesses,
payroll is the single greatest expense they will incur.  Therefore, it
becomes beneficial to understand the foundational elements associated
with payroll applications. The process of payroll can be divided into
four major areas:
-   Government compliance (includes, but is not limited to): reporting
    based on the amount of payroll dollars; depositing of taxes
    collected from the employee, sometimes matched by the employer, or
    sometimes deposited by only the employer on the employee’s behalf;
    and providing summaries of annual payroll activity of each person
    who received any compensation from the organization.
-   Employee processing (includes, but is not limited to): new hire
    administrative actives and paperwork, tracking and reporting payroll
    changes, collecting and properly filing payroll data.
-   Payroll processing (includes, but is not limited to): data entry,
    reconciliation, and distribution of reports.
-   Employer compliance (includes, but is not limited to): the issuing
    of W-2’s.

 **Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and any of its assigned materials. 
In each unit of this course, there is strategic information provided to
support your understanding of payroll applications.  It is very
important that you take notes as you work through this course, and use

to complete.  The time advisory does not include the amount of time it
may take you to write out your notes or prep for the final exam.  The

over the next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for
yourself.  For example, if you find that it takes you longer to obtain
the insight or information you need from a reading, and you have to read
