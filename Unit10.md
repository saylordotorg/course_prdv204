**Unit 10: Payroll Tax: Returns and Penalties** <span id="10"></span> 

*Just as an employee has to file a tax return reflecting the payroll
activity that happened for the previous year, an employer also has to
file a series of returns to identify and report the payroll activity
that has happened for a specified period.  Among the reports an employer
has to submit are the FUTA (Federal Unemployment Tax) and SUTA (State
Unemployment Tax).  The collection of these taxes is an expense an
employer incurs on the behalf of each person who is considered an
employee.  The money collected is deposited into an account and is the
foundational source for paying unemployment insurance to eligible former
employees. In addition to developing an understanding of the returns an
employer has to submit, you will also obtain a foundational
understanding of the penalties that are applied when compliance to the
reporting requirements does not happen.*
