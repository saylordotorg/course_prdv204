**Unit 6: Benefits: Fringe Benefits, Recognition, and Market Value**
<span id="6"></span> 

*According to investopedia.com, fringe benefits are a collection of
various benefits provided by an employer, which are exempt from taxation
as long as certain conditions are met.  Any employee who receives
taxable fringe benefits will have to include the fair market value of
the benefits in their taxable income for the year, which will be subject
to tax withholdings and Social Security benefits payments.  These
benefits could include, but are not limited to, tuition reimbursement,
personal use of company vehicles, or childcare assistance.  This unit
will provide you with some foundational insight on some of the fringe
benefits.*
