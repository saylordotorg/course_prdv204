**Unit 7: Benefits—Insurance, Retirement, and Flexible Plans** <span
id="7"></span> 

*As we continue our study of benefits, it is important to note that the
only benefits an employer is required to offer an employee are workers
compensation, social security tax, family and medical leave,
unemployment insurance, and in some cases COBRA benefits.  If an
employer offers benefits outside of the aforementioned list of benefits,
these are identified as voluntary.  This section of the course provides
you with a closer look at benefits, and bolsters your understanding of
what is applicable, and to whom it applies.*
