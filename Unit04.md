id="4"></span> 

*The Sixteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution allows the
federal government to collect taxes on forms of income, as they deem
appropriate.  When the federal government collects these taxes, the
money is used to fund federal projects like federal student loans, and
to pay the compensation of the government workers who keep all aspects
of the federal government going. In this unit you will learn about the
federal tax-collection process associated with payroll, and you will
develop an understanding of Social Security and Medicare taxes.*
