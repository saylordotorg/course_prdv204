**Unit 1: Payroll Foundations and Understanding Pay** <span
id="1"></span> 

*The basic understanding of payroll can be looked at from a few
different perspectives.  Perspective 1: Payroll can be identified as the
total of all financial records associated with an individual employee.
 This is the identification of payroll from an organizational
perspective.  Perspective 2: Payroll can be looked at as the amount an
employee receives from an employer in exchange for labor.  This is the
identification of payroll from the employee's perspective.  Perspective
3: Payroll can be identified as the process through which taxes are
collected and remitted to the appropriate authorities.  Regardless of
the perspective that is most familiar to you, this unit will provide you
with some foundational insight that frames the basic understanding of
payroll and the pay process.*
